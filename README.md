## 0. Initialize a Local Repository and Push to GitHub

### Objective: 

Learn how to create a file locally, initialize a Git repository, commit your changes, and push the repository to GitHub.

#### Skills Practiced:

- Initializing a Git repository
- Basic Git commands (add, commit, push)
- Creating a new repository on GitHub
- Pushing a local repository to GitHub

#### Expected Outcome:

*You will have a local Git repository with a single file (hello.txt) committed. This repository will be pushed to GitHub, where the file will be visible in your new LocalRepoProject repository.*

#### Notes:

- This project is designed to introduce the fundamental workflow of using Git locally and pushing changes to a remote repository on GitHub.
- Ensure you replace <REPOSITORY-URL> with the actual URL provided by GitHub when you create your online repository.

**Repo: GitHub repository: LocalRepoProject**
